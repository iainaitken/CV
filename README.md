## About me

A full-stack software developer and a personable team player.

I graduated from a 12-week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy on 23 April 2021, having previously been a solicitor for over 13 years.

I love working on software projects; there's no greater satisfaction than being able to contribute to developing a system that works and which makes someone's life that bit easier. I take pride in my work and, as a professional, I strive to ensure that my code is clean, readable, easy to maintain and reusable. I am looking for a job where I can hone my coding skills, learn as much as possible and quickly progress my career.

## Skills

#### Communication

Clear communication has been a core part of my career to date, evidenced by:

- 13 years of client-facing roles; I pride myself in being able to explain complex legal concepts in plain English.
- Written communication, adapting my style depending on whether I am writing to clients or other legal professionals. 
- Public speaking; through delivering seminars, training sessions and presentations, and participating in client-facing panel discussions.

#### Attention to Detail

I have spent countless hours drafting and reviewing complex legal documents where attention to detail is vital. 

#### Self-learning

I am highly motivated to learn new skills. Early in my career I single-handedly reformed and improved the private client offering at Stapletons Solicitors, leading to a 175% increase in fees received per annum. This required a complete overhaul of the department, learning about and implementing:

- Risk management.
- Internal know-how.
- Introducing new work areas.
- Marketing, including cross-selling within the firm, and building a network of referrers. 
- New software solutions such as an MS Access database to track client documents in physical storage.

I have increased efficiency, profitability and consistency of approach at every firm I have worked at by developing precedent banks. This would require learning a great deal of detail about the documents and underlying legal effects, among other things. I also worked with in-house case management developers to create will-writing software.

I am currently independently learning Python to expand my coding skillset.

#### Project Management

In my role at Trowers & Hamlins, I was responsible for managing complex, high-value client transactions centred on the "de-enveloping" of UK property owned by offshore companies. This work would involve acting as a single point of contact for the client and coordinating the work of several other professionals. I was also responsible for advising on the legal and often complex tax implications of the transaction.

#### Analysis

I would regularly be required to analyse data and fact patterns.  This might for example include:

- Examining new legislation in detail to ascertain the potential impact on clients.
- Analysing client fact patterns, and applying legal rules to those facts to figure out likely outcomes.
- Financial performance statistics.

#### Teamwork and Leadership

Working with others is evidenced by:

- I have managed teams of solicitors and legal assistants.
- As a solicitor, I acted as mentor to more junior members of the team. During Makers, I volunteered to be a mentor for two fellow students who were in a later cohort.
- Improved training and progression for junior team members through the implementation of a department-wide training course on relevant legal topics.
- Improved the acquisition of, and dissemination of know-how between, fee-earners by implementing, co-ordinating and chairing weekly department knowledge meetings. 

#### Marketing

As a solicitor, as I progressed up the career ladder I engaged more with marketing efforts, such as:

- Networking and building relationships with potential clients and referrers.
- Writing articles and brochures.
- Using social media.
